# SMTGodot

A Shin Megami Tensei (SMT) like game made with Godot 3. One day for fun I decided to make a turn based rpg with Godot. As I was progressing in my dev, I took SMT battle style and dungeon crawing as model. The battle system is to be refactored and optimized. But so far it work. I didn't had the time to continue on this project, so I upload it here on GitHub, might help someone interested in making such a game using this engine.
